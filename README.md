# replication_ML_magnetism_discovery

The following repo is for a replication study for the DFT-aided machine learning-based discovery of magnetism in Fe-based bimetallic chalcogenides. Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-30438-w

The python notebook is taken from the orginal paper, and it was used to confirm the results. Source: https://github.com/dppant/magnetism-prediction

The "original process" folder has the original code for the methods in the paper and is taken from the paper. Source: https://github.com/dppant/magnetism-prediction

The code in the other folders of my work where I test out different combinations of base learners and subsets of training data have some of the same preprocessing and training methods, and they are explicitly cited when needed.
